This project is a Flappy Bird AI Trainer implemented in Python using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The purpose of this trainer is to train an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to play the popular game Flappy Bird.

## Features

- NEAT algorithm: The trainer uses NEAT, a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks to optimize their performance in playing Flappy Bird.
- Python implementation: The project is written in Python, making it accessible and easy to understand for developers familiar with the language.
- Simple UI: The user interface provides a basic display of the game screen and training progress, allowing you to monitor the AI's performance.
- Settings menu: Although currently under development, the trainer will eventually include a settings menu where you can customize various parameters to fine-tune the AI training process.

## Installation

To run the Flappy Bird AI Trainer, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/W3ndig0u0/FlappyBirdAI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
